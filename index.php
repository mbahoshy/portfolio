			<p>My name is Matthew Ross, and I am seeking employment in web development. After graduating from the University of Washington, I spent a year working at a start up company, Priveazy. For the past year and a half, I have been living in Wenatchee, working at my parent's business installing and servicing HVAC equipment. During this time I have worked on several web projects that employ a variety of web development technologies.</p>

				<p>The word 'education' has evolved new meaning as I have grown as a person. I attended preparatory high school, where excellence was standard, and I flourished academically showing promise in mathematics and science amoung other studies.</p>
				<p>It was during my senior year of high school, and through my first years of college that the word education had somehow required a negative connotation. It was something to be avoided, despised... it was a 'chore' and utterly uncool. It became a quintessential time of 'finding myself' where my formal education took a back seat to more philosophical pursuits.</p>
				<p>It wasn't until my senior year in college, that I fell again for learning. Finally I began to understand how empowering knowledge can be. I finished my college career receiving excellent marks my senior year. But the passion I re-discovered for learning had just begun.</p>
				<p>After graduating, I found myself devouring educational non-fiction. Javascript, PHP, XML, SQL, TCP/IP protocols, web penetration, circuits and controls, even motorcycle tech books... whatever I could get my hands on. My bookshelf is now full of books that expand possibilities. I have learned that true power is the application of knowledge.</p>

				<p><span class='bold'>UW Surplus Store 2008-2011</span>
				<br	/>One of my duties (among many) at the store was to wipe hard drives and prepare computers to be publicly sold. I learned a lot about computer hardware from this job, and it helped ignite my passion for technology.</p>
				
				<p><span class='bold'>Priveazy 2011-2012</span>
				<br	/>My first job out of college, I was hired to write 'lessons' that educated people about various privacy and security issues. My respsonsibilites extended far beyond that by the time I was finished.</p>
				
				<p><span class='bold'>Alpine Aire Heating & Cooling 2012-Present</span>
				<br	/>Working in a small business, my respsonsibilites varied widely. Aside from maintaining the website, I was a service technician, lead installer, office worker, and consultant.</p>

		<!--After graduating college, I spent one year working at a start-up technology company, Priveazy. Priveazy is a website that is designed to educate people about how to protect their identities and personal information online. Here I was exposed to a professional development environment. Being only two people in size, I became a jack of all trades.
				<p>I was hired at Priveazy because of my ability to effectively communicate ideas in a way that is easily comprehendable. I became familiar with the command line of Github, to manage and collaborate on coding. I also became really involved in analysing user experiences on the website. It was often a favorite past time of mine to take a screenshot of a particular page on the website, and to complete a 'mock-up' of how I think the website <i>should</i> look. These were presented to my boss, with detailed explanations of why my layout/design/application was better for the user.</p>
				<p>During the process of creating this website, we came across the need to prepare animated videos. While struggling to figure out what to do, I downloaded a copy of the Adobe suite on my own time. I quickly gained confidence using the Adobe After Effects program to create simple animations, and to personally record, edit, and overlay the appropriate audio. I took the initiative to learn these skills on my own hour, and they became a large and critical part of my job.</p> -->
