			<p>Priveazy was my first job I earned after college. It was an educational start-up company founded by Jay, a Mircrosoft programmer, and was focused on teaching people how to stay private and secure online. Priveazy was great exposure for me into the habits of a professional developing environment. The company was very small- Jay, myself, and two interns. As a result, I became a sort of jack-of-all trades. Although I was initially hired to write lessons, I was soon designing, developing, creating (simple) graphics, perfoming usability tests, and even animating.</p>

				<p>The concept of Priveazy revolved around the lesson. Users would enter the site, and choose a topic that interested them. An example of a lesson would be 'Webmail Security'. The lesson would consist of 6 - 12 'slides' each containing a few paragraphs of information. Each slide had associated 'tasks'. Tasks are step by step instructions for completing the recommendations made in the slides. An example task may show users how to check and change their password recovery questions. 'Quizzes' were short 5 question tests that were designed to be taken before the lesson, to entice the user to learn more about a topic.</p>
				<p>My primary responsibility at Priveazy was to write lessons, tasks, and quizzes.</p>

				<p>One of the concerns that Jay and myself had while building this project was whether or not people were likely to actually spend time reading the lessons we created. We resolved to create short, informative, videos to that explained basic internet technologies to the uninitiated. All of the concepts, scripts, drawing, animation, voiceovers, editing, and producing was done by myself (with the exception of the opening whiteboard animation - this was done by an intern before I began making videos).</p>
				<p>Generally, the process would work like this: Jay and I would decide which topic we would create our next video about. We would then have a conversation about the main points that each of us wanted to highlight in the video. Next, I would create the initial storyboard and script. Everyday Jay and I would go through the storyboard and script to make revisions, play with wording, flush out the animations, etc. I would then return the next day with the revised script and the process would repeat itself.</p>
				<p>The resulting videos were a collaboration between the two of us. The videos were always 'my' prjoect, but they were overseen and shaped by Jay. Both of us were very opinionated about our ideas, and compromises were often made by each of us while we hammered out details. We had some great conversations and debates, that ultimately made our scripts and videos a stronger product.</p>
				<p>The video above was one of the later videos I created with Priveazy.</p>
