			<p>Alpineaire.net was my first opportunity to create a consumer facing public web page from conception to completion. This project was undertaken after having left Priveazy, and presented it's own unique challenges. My initial focus in creating this webpage was usability and design. I believe that simplicity is supreme when it comes to both of these concepts, and I built a beautiful webpage that reflected this ideal. However, in web development, compromises must be made.</p>
			<p>This site is live at <a href='http://www.alpineaire.net' target='_blank'>alpineaire.net</a> - Feel free to visit on a desktop, or mobile device!</p>

				<p>Alpine Aire was developed to reach the largest audience possible. Usability and design must both be accessible to the lowest common denominator. That being said, I still wanted the website to feel beautiful and modern. The most important piece of information customers are looking for when visiting our website is a phone number. The Alpine Aire phone number is displayed prominently in the header on all of the pages.</p>
				<p>I want to invoke certain emotions from a user when they visit this website. I want them to feel that our company is natural, simple, and honest. That is why I created a new tagline <i>Breathe Naturally</i> to display on our website. The quotes beneath the main slideshow are meant to draw the user into a sense of community with our company.</p>
				<p>Also displayed prominently on the landing page, is a form to quickly contact Alpine Aire. When submitted, the form will generate one email to an Alpine Aire employee with all relevant information, and another stylized email will be generated to the customer to confirm the submission.</p>
				<p>The footer of the website is identical on all pages. It offers the customer our address on contact information on each page (as well as the phone number on the top of each page). Also available here are links that the average visitor may not be looking for (like a Jobs page).</p>

				<p>After the design of the webpage was complete, and I began to fill the pages with content, my focus shifted drastically to SEO. Alpine Aire is an HVAC company- many of our customers perform a basic search on the Internet if their AC or heating fails. SEO is vitally important to attracting new customers who had no previous affiliation with a company.</p>
				<p>As I began to learn SEO techniques, the usability and design of the webpage changed to accomodate SEO practices. The most difficult compromise for myself to make was the amount of text on the landing page. To perform well in SEO, I had to write a lot more text than I would consider to be aesthetically or user friendly. I carefully chose sentences and words that were targeted towards our key terms. All HTML markup has been writted to grow our SEO efforts.</p>
				<p> Additionally, I spent some time working of off-page optimization. New links were submitted to replace the old and broken ones on dealer websites. I set up our Google, Bing, Facebook, and Yelp business pages.</p>
				<p>To track our websites performance, I implemented and monitored a Google Analytics account. Google Adwords and Bing Ads were also used strategically at different times of the year.</p>
				<p>The optimization is now a successfull running operation. Alpineaire.net appears on top of the organic results for such key search phrases as 'ac repair', performed in the Wenatchee area, on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

				<p>When a person is searching for an HVAC service company, it is most often in times of distress, and the search will be performed on a mobile device. Alpineaire.net uses a mobile detect feature to redirect users to a mobile friendly version of the website.</p>
				<p>The mobile site must take special consideration of space. The desgin of this mobile site is ultra-simplistic, and intuitive to use. The most important piece of information, in the context of Alpine Aire, is the phone number link. Most users who search on a mobile device are ready to make a phone call to schedule service. For this reason, the phone number appears as the most prominent feature on the page, and is loaded into your smart phone dialer when clicked.</p>
				<p>Users can also find key information such as business hours, location, a contact form, and our Facebook page.</p>
